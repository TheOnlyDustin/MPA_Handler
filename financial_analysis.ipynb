# Financial Analysis Application

In this notebook, you will create agents to review financial documents and generate a Market Price Analysis (MPA) using the CrewAI framework.

## Installation

Install the required packages:
```sh
!pip install -r requirements.txt

import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
import os
from utils import get_openai_api_key

openai_api_key = get_openai_api_key()
